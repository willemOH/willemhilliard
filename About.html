                           Willem Hilliard is a third-year student at Bennington College, Vermont where he studies Visual Arts and Computer Science. Through a long and evolving interest in 3D graphics, mindfulness practices, and interactive experiences, he has taken to real-time interactive rendering engines like Unity and immersive spaces such as installation, AR, and VR to create works which answer these interests. 
                            <p></p>
                            Taking experience from his internship at 1RIC studios and immersed deeply in the possibilities of interactive media at Sundance 2019â€™s New Frontier showings, he is now focusing on low-level shading language scripting and mindfulness techniques to increase audience immersion, his next project will be a VR experience exploring these skills and concepts.
